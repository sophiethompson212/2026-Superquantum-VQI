Solutions to 11 Clifford+T Synthesis Problems

This repository contains solutions to 11 quantum circuit compilation problems, each focused on implementing a target unitary using the Clifford+T gates under fault-tolerant constraints. The problems progress in complexity, ranging from standard 2-bit controlled-gate decompositions to four-qubit circuits.

Scope and Objectives

The primary objective across all problems is to minimize fault-tolerant cost, with particular emphasis on reducing non-Clifford resources such as 𝑇-gate count and circuit efficiency, while maintaining correctness. Each solution is provided as an OpenQASM 2.0 or OpenQasm 3.0 circuit and is walked through on the document attatched.
